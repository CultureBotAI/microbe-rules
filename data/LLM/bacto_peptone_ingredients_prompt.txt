What to Include


Goal:
Identify and list well-documented chemical ingredients found in general bacto peptone (i.e., open to broader biochemical compositions) specifically used for bacterial culturing (not for malt or fungi).


Scope:
Include only compounds explicitly reported in peer-reviewed publications or reliable biochemical analyses as present in bacto peptones.
Prioritize peer-reviewed literature from the last 10 years; use older peer-reviewed sources only if no newer references exist.
If no peer-reviewed source is found, well-documented data from recognized biochemical suppliers (e.g., Sigma-Aldrich, Difco) may be used as supplementary evidence (not primary).


Scope Exclusions:
Do not include inferred compounds based on malt biochemistry.
Do not include ambiguous compounds (i.e., reported but not well-characterized).
Do not consider contaminants.
Do not include structures or structural descriptions.
Do not specify ingredient sources or brand-specific data.


Hierarchy:
Organize the table in a nested way (superclasses, then subclasses/instances) for readability.
No additional intermediary categories unless they help clarify grouping.


Trace Elements/Cofactors:
Use broad categories (e.g., “Trace Minerals”) but list important individual entities (e.g., “Iron,” “Zinc”) as separate rows beneath the category.


Literature Priority:
Use peer-reviewed publications first (published within the last 10 years if available).
Supplement with other reliable sources or biochemical analyses if needed, but only for documented compounds (no inferences).


No Quantities:
Do not provide percentages or concentration data.


No Additional Notes:
Provide only the five required columns; do not include extra commentary.


Classification Preferences:
Group related compounds flexibly rather than strictly separating each subcategory (e.g., dipeptides can be grouped with peptides).


Bound vs. Free: Assume peptides and nucleotides are bound unless explicit reports state they are free.


Carbohydrates and Lipids:
Include major documented carbohydrates and lipids (for carbon/nitrogen and other nutrient sources needed in bulk). Ignore trace carbohydrates and lipids.


Chemical Classes to Cover (Examples):
Amino acids
Peptides
Nucleic acids and nucleotides
Carbohydrates
Fatty acids (or broader lipids)
Vitamins and cofactors
Trace minerals/metals
Table Requirements


Output: A single, structured Markdown TSV table.


Columns (five total):
Chemical Name/Class
Free/Bound
Universal/Variable (based on occurrence in bacto peptones)
Broad/Specific
Role (possible values: “bulk” or “trace”)


Nested Organization:
Begin with broad categories (e.g., “Amino Acids”).
List subclasses or individual chemicals (e.g., “Alanine,” “Cysteine”) beneath each heading.


Example Row:
Chemical Name/Class        Free/Bound        Universal/Variable        Broad/Specific        Role
Amino Acids        free        universal        broad        bulk
Alanine        free        universal        broad        bulk
Cysteine        free        universal        broad        bulk
Trace Minerals        bound        universal        broad        trace
Iron (Fe)        bound        universal        broad        trace
Zinc (Zn)        bound        variable        broad        trace


Use these instructions to create a clear, detailed table of well-documented bacto peptone ingredients — for bacterial culturing only — without adding extra notes or context beyond the required five columns.
