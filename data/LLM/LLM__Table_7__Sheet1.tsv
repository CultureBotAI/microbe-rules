Rule or Rule Set or Feature Set	Property of Medium or Isolation	Brief Rationale	Citation	Citation Link
Rule #1	No esculin β-glucosidase competition	Antibiotic producers avoid esculin degradation, preserving energy for secondary metabolism rather than competing for β-glucosidase substrates	Niu, G., Chater, K. F., Tian, Y., Zhang, J., & Tan, H. (2016). Specialised metabolites regulating antibiotic biosynthesis in Streptomyces spp. FEMS Microbiology Reviews, 40(4), 554-573.	https://doi.org/10.1093/femsre/fuw012
Rule #2	Organic nitrogen preference over nitrate	Complex peptides/amino acids from yeast extract support antibiotic biosynthesis better than inorganic nitrate reduction	Czajgucka, Z. et al. (2021). Influence of the Medium Composition and the Culture Conditions on Surfactin Biosynthesis by a Native Bacillus subtilis natto BS19 Strain. Molecules 26(10):2985	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34069825/
Rule #3	Non-urease antibiotic producers	Avoids ammonia toxicity that interferes with antibiotic synthesis; pH buffered by CaCO₃ instead	Braña, A. F., Wolfe, S., & Demain, A. L. (1985). Ammonium repression of cephalosporin production by Streptomyces clavuligerus. Canadian Journal of Microbiology, 31(8), 736–743.	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3841023/
Rule #4	Oxidoreductase-independent mannosidase activity	Alternative energy pathways using malt-derived mannans/oligosaccharides rather than conventional redox reactions	Shi, P., et al. (2011). Cloning and characterization of a new β-mannosidase from Streptomyces sp. S27. Enzyme and Microbial Technology, 49(3), 277-283.	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2011.06.003
Rules #5,6	Glucose-independent specialized enzymes	Mannosidase/urease producers utilize complex malt oligosaccharides (maltotriose, dextrins) over simple glucose	Van Wezel, G.P., et al. (1997). Substrate induction and glucose repression of maltose utilization by Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) is controlled by malR. Molecular Microbiology, 23(3), 537-549.	https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2958.1997.d01-1878.x
Set of Rules #1,2,3	Antibiotic production metabolic profile	Organisms suited to complex media with 50+ compounds from yeast/malt extracts, avoiding simple substrate competition	Aluotto, S., et al. (2013). Development of a semi-defined medium supporting production of platensimycin and platencin by Streptomyces platensis. Journal of Antibiotics, 66(2), 51-54.	https://doi.org/10.1038/ja.2012.97
Set of Rules #4,5,6	Specialized carbohydrate processing	Emphasis on glycosidase activities utilizing malt β-glucans and mannans over glucose oxidation	Malgas, S., et al. (2015). A review of the enzymatic hydrolysis of mannans and synergistic interactions between β-mannanase, β-mannosidase and α-galactosidase. World Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology, 31(8), 1167-1175.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11274-015-1878-2
Feature Set: Negated compounds	Complex nutrient preference	Absence of esculin, nitrate, glucose utilization indicates reliance on diverse amino acids, nucleotides, vitamins from extracts	Hopwood, D. A. (2019). Highlights of Streptomyces genetics. Heredity, 123(1), 23-32.	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41437-019-0196-0
Feature Set: Enzymatic activities	Secondary metabolite specialization	Alpha-mannosidase and urease activities support Streptomyces-like traits on pH-buffered (CaCO₃) rich medium	Demain, A. L., & Inamine, E. (1970). Biochemistry and regulation of streptomycin and mannosidostreptomycinase (α-D-mannosidase) formation. Bacteriological Reviews, 34(1), 1–19.	https://doi.org/10.1128/br.34.1.1-19.1970
Feature: production:antibiotic compound	Streptomyces selective enrichment	GYM medium’s B-vitamins (especially B₃, B₅, B₆) and trace metals (Fe, Zn, Mn) support polyketide/peptide antibiotic pathways	Van der Heul, H.U., et al. (2018). Regulation of antibiotic production in Actinobacteria: new perspectives from the post-genomic era. Nature Product Reports, 35, 575-604.	https://doi.org/10.1039/C8NP00012C
